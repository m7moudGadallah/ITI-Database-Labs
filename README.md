## Description

This is the ITI-Database-Labs repository. It's here for me to store my solutions to ITI database labs that use Microsoft SQL Server. If you're also working on these labs or need some SQL practice, you might find it useful.

## How to Use

**1. Accessing the Solutions:** Just hit the "Code" button and download everything I've got here, including the database backups.

**2. Lab-Specific Folders:** Each lab **_[here](./labs/)_** has its own folder. That's where you'll find the SQL code I've used and the corresponding database backup file.

**3. Exploring the Solutions:** Open a lab folder, and you'll see a README explaining the lab's purpose. There's also the SQL script I wrote to solve the lab.

**4. Your Turn to Shine:** Feel free to dive into the SQL, reuse it, or give it your twist. The best way to learn is by doing!

> **Note:** Additionally, remember to access the **database backup** files from the "**_[backups.zip](./backups.zip)_**" archive. These backups can be a great starting point for exploring and experimenting with the lab scenarios.
