```sql
select CONCAT(s.St_Fname, ' ', s.St_Lname) as student_fullname,
		c.Crs_Name as course_name
from Student s inner join Stud_Course sc
on  s.St_Id = sc.St_Id
inner join Course c

```sql
select min(Salary) as min_salary, max(Salary) as max_salary

All Salaries is null so output will be (null, null) so I filled table with this query

```sql
/*
	fill salaries
*/
with tmp_instructor as(
	select *, NTILE(5) over(partition by dept_id order by Ins_id) as nt
	from Instructor where Salary is null
)

--select * from tmp_instructor

update tmp_instructor
	set salary =
		case
			when nt = 1 then 2500
			when nt = 2 then 4000
			when nt = 3 then 6000
			when nt = 4 then 7000
			else 10000
		end
